# Arithmetics Kata

TypeScript starter code for the [Arithmetics kata](https://katalyst.codurance.com/arithmetics). 
    

## Instructions

Create a function that can parse simple mathematical expressions in the following format:

```text
( 1 + 2 )
```

All of the operations are wrapped in parentheses and all tokens (parentheses, operands and numbers) should be separated by a space.



## Possble extensions
- Drop the requirement for every element to be space-separated.
- Drop the requirement for all operations to be wrapped in parentheses and deduce operation order from operator precedence rules instead.
